This is a website for the Evil Genius Co-Operative!  One of the features of the site is the Evil Name Generator which uses an object literal to generate your evil name.  The Site features a shop, a sign up page, a login page, a contact page, an about us page, a home page.  The store has items displayed in it up but shopping cart is not fully functional yet. 

I did a Trello board with the user stories for three different types of users that might visit the website.

Features that will be in future updates include:
-ability to vote on plots for world domination posted by other members
-get friend suggestions based on which members you have the highest number of shared likes with
-find local meet-ups near you
-buy tickets to the 2018 World Domination Summit
-post ads to find minions
-functioning shopping cart
-add more items to the store
-ability to create personalized agenda based on which sessions at World Domination Summit that you want to attend
-Ability to not have to re-enter log-in details if remember me checkbox is checked
-Be Greeted by name after logging in to site or creating a new account
-Profile page for each member displaying their Evil Genius Name, their ideas for world domination, a list of their likes and dislikes,
their zipcode, how long they have been a member, what type of evil genius you are
-Quiz to determine which type of evil genius that you are
